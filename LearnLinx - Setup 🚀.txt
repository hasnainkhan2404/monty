COLOR
1. Color Combinations:
                           * Blue and White:
A classic, professional look that works well for corporate websites and landing pages needing a sense of trust and clarity. 
                           * Blue and Orange:
This complementary pairing offers a visually stimulating experience, with blue providing stability and orange adding a pop of energy. 
                           * Monochrome with Accent:
A minimalist approach using black, white, and gray, with a bright accent color (like yellow or orange) for calls to action. 
                           * Green and White:
Suitable for courses related to nature, wellness, or sustainability. 
                           * Purple and White/Gray:
Purple can convey creativity and luxury. Use it with a neutral background for a sophisticated look. 
3. The 60/30/10 Rule:
                              * 60% Main Color:
Use your primary color (like blue or white) as the dominant color on the page, often for the background or large sections of content. 
                              * 30% Secondary Color:
Choose a color that complements your main color (like orange with blue) and use it for headings, forms, and other key areas. 
                              * 10% Accent Color:
This should be a contrasting color (like bright yellow or red) used for call-to-action buttons, icons, or other elements you want to stand out.
